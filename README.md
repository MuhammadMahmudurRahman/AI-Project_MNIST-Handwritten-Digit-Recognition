# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Machine Learning

## This project aims to recognize handwritten digits using three different machine learning algorithms to train classifiers, with a focus on using Python and the scikit-learn library.

### Machine Learning Models Used in the Project:

• Logistic Regression

• Support Vector Machine (SVM)

• Random Forest
